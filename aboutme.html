			Currently a freshman majoring Computer Science at UIUC, I graduated from NYC's best: Stuyvesant High School. <br>I love cars;
			I've been driving for a few months. I love music; I've been producing for a few years. <br>I love computers; I've been tinkering with them for a decade.
			<br>Not a lot going on in my life, but then again, I've got the future ahead of me and it'll be great!
